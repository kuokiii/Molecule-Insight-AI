# Molecule Insight AI

Molecule Insight AI is an advanced web application designed to empower students and researchers with AI-driven molecular insights. This platform offers a range of features to classify, visualize, and understand complex molecular structures with ease.

## Features

- **Molecule Classification**: Enter molecular formulas to get detailed information about compounds.
- **3D Molecule Visualization**: Interactive 3D rendering of molecular structures.
- **Molecule Comparison**: Compare two different molecules side by side.
- **Periodic Table**: Interactive periodic table with detailed element information.
- **Functional Group Guide**: Learn about various functional groups in organic chemistry.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system.


## Technologies Used

- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Three.js (for 3D molecule visualization)
- Framer Motion (for animations)
